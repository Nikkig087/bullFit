## Design & Planning:


### Wireframes

## Agile Methodology

### My Approach to Agile Methodology
As I developed this project, I used the Agile methodology because of its flexibility and iterative process. Agile helped me stay organized and adapt as the project evolved. Working in short, manageable cycles (or "sprints") allowed me to make continuous progress and improve each feature step-by-step. This approach gave me the structure I needed to regularly assess my progress and refine the app as I moved forward.

#### Benefits in Testing for Me:

Agile was especially beneficial for testing each function of my app. Since I worked in small increments, I was able to test each feature thoroughly as I completed it. This brought a lot of advantages:

- Quickly Finding Issues: By testing after each sprint, I caught bugs and issues early, avoiding larger problems down the line.
- Better Quality: Testing in each phase ensured that the app’s functionality met my standards before moving on to the next feature.
- Flexibility: As new ideas or changes came up, I was able to easily adjust the plan without losing track of the overall project.
- Continuous Improvement: Each testing cycle helped me fine-tune the app and my own development process, so I could deliver a more polished final product.

### MoSCoW Prioritization
To keep myself focused, I used the MoSCoW method to prioritize the tasks and features I needed to work on. I broke everything down into:

Must Have: Features that were critical to the app’s core functionality.
- Should Have: Important features that weren’t essential, but added significant value.
- Could Have: Features that would be nice to include if time allowed.
- Won’t Have: Features that I decided not to include in the current version.
This prioritization method helped me stay on track, ensuring that I worked on the most important features first and kept the project manageable.

### Managing with GitHub Projects
I used GitHub Projects to organize my tasks and track my progress. Each project board represented an EPIC (a major part of the app), and I created columns like "To Do," "In Progress," "On Hold," "Done," and "Bugs" to visualize where each task stood. I also used labels to categorize tasks based on their priority and organized them into sprints to stay on track.

### Visualizing Progress with the Kanban Board
I relied on a Kanban board to manage my progress. Seeing my tasks move through different stages—from "To Do" to "Done"—gave me a clear sense of accomplishment and kept me motivated throughout the project. It also helped me ensure that no task was overlooked or forgotten.

## Breaking Down the EPICS
Each Epic in my project represented a major feature or functionality of the platform. By breaking these large tasks into smaller, manageable parts, I was able to tackle each piece step-by-step. This ensured that nothing was left incomplete, and every aspect of the app was thoroughly developed.

### Typography
Explain font you've used for your project
### Colour Scheme
I chose a brown and burlywood color scheme for the website to create a specific atmosphere that resonates with both trust and confidence. Brown, being an earthy tone, is often associated with feelings of warmth, calm, and stability. When visitors come to the site, I want them to feel grounded and reassured, almost as if the site itself is something solid and dependable. Brown has that quality of being strong yet inviting, which helps in building a sense of trust in the information presented. It subtly conveys that the content is reliable and backed by a firm foundation.

On the other hand, Burlywood brings a different energy to the design. Known for its associations with subtle sophistication and warmth, I want to use burlywood to signal the richness of the knowledge available on the site. Whether visitors are exploring the benefits of different exercises or learning new techniques, the use of burlywood is meant to inspire confidence. It’s there to communicate that the knowledge shared is valuable and that by engaging with it, users can feel empowered to try new things and experiment with their fitness journey.

In combining these two colors, I aim to create an experience where users not only feel they are accessing trustworthy and solid information but are also encouraged to take bold, confident steps in applying what they learn. Brown sets the stage with a calm, reliable foundation, while burlywood brings in a sense of warmth and assurance to explore new possibilities. Together, these colors balance warmth and sophistication, creating a space that feels both welcoming and empowering.

### DataBase Diagram

The project's data model is based on an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that maps out the relationships between the different Django models. At the core is the User model, which extends Django's default User class with fields like id, username, password, and email. Each user can create Exercises that include attributes such as title, description, two levels of detailed descriptions, and images (handled by Cloudinary fields). Exercises are tied to the user who created them through a Foreign Key.

Users can also leave Comments on exercises, with fields for the content of the comment, when it was created, and whether it’s been approved. Additionally, users can report comments by filing CommentReports, which link both the user and the specific comment in question. There’s also a ContactMessage model, which allows visitors to send messages to the site admins.

In terms of relationships, a User can have multiple Exercises, Comments, and CommentReports (one-to-many relationships). Similarly, an Exercise can have many Comments, and a Comment can have multiple CommentReports. The ERD lays this out clearly, showing how the different models connect and interact.

## To Do
Images are not high quality therefore I would like to have a professional photographer for a real world website.  Also when password reset is completed, the email functionality is not fully set up however the terminal does confirm the functionality of the submission.

## Bugs
## Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database 
- Log into [CIdatabase maker](https://www.heroku.com/](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/))
- add your email address in input field and submit the form
- open database link in your email
- paste dabase URL in your DATABASE_URL variable in env.py file and in Heroku config vars

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** section and enter the **DATABASE_URL** which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create **Secret key** this can be anything,
**CLOUDINARY_URL** this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally **Port** which will be set to 8000.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **GitHub** and click **connect**
- Once it has been connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.
