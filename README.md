## Agile Methodology
### Overview

Agile methodology is a project management approach that emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal. It is particularly effective in software development where requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing cross-functional teams. Agile methodologies aim to deliver small, incremental changes in a product to improve quality and adaptability to changing needs.


### MoSCoW Prioritization

The MoSCoW prioritization technique is used to determine the importance of various features and tasks in a project. This method categorizes features into four groups: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Won't Have. This helps in effective time management and ensures that the most critical functionalities are delivered first.

### GitHub Projects

Using GitHub Projects, tasks are managed and progress tracked through project boards. Each board will represent an EPIC, with columns for tasks, their statuses (To Do, In Progress, On Hold, Done, Bugs). Issue labels include the user, prioritization and sprints.

### EPICS

Epic is a large body of work that is broken down into user stories. Each Epic in this project represents a key aspect of the platform's development and ensures comprehensive coverage of the required functionalities.

### User Stories

With an emphasis on delivering a seamless user experience, the goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive platform that serves both visitors and registered users. The platform will allow for the development and maintenance of content, present developer profiles, and provide opportunities for interaction.  The following user stories outline the essential functionalities and the rationale behind them.

## Deployment
This website is deployed to Heroku from a GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

#### Creating an app on Heroku
- After creating the repository on GitHub, head over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and sign in.
- On the home page, click **New** and **Create new app** from the drop down.
- Give the app a name(this must be unique) and select a **region** I chose **Europe** as I am in Europe, Then click **Create app**.

#### Create a database 
- Log into [CIdatabase maker](https://www.heroku.com/](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net/))
- add your email address in input field and submit the form
- open database link in your email
- paste dabase URL in your DATABASE_URL variable in env.py file and in Heroku config vars

#### Deploying to Heroku.
- Head back over to [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and click on your **app** and then go to the **Settings tab**
- On the **settings page** scroll down to the **config vars** section and enter the **DATABASE_URL** which you will set equal to the elephantSQL URL, create **Secret key** this can be anything,
**CLOUDINARY_URL** this will be set to your cloudinary url and finally **Port** which will be set to 8000.
- Then scroll to the top and go to the **deploy tab** and go down to the **Deployment method** section and select **Github** and then sign into your account.
- Below that in the **search for a repository to connect to** search box enter the name of your repository that you created on **GitHub** and click **connect**
- Once it has been connected scroll down to the **Manual Deploy** and click **Deploy branch** when it has deployed you will see a **view app** button below and this will bring you to your newly deployed app.
- Please note that when deploying manually you will have to deploy after each change you make to your repository.
